# 🎓 ScoreGenie

**ScoreGenie** is a simple yet effective machine learning project that predicts a student’s final exam grade based on their academic and personal data. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and a live interactive web app powered by Streamlit.

---

## 🔧 Features

- 🔄 Data cleaning and encoding of categorical features  
- 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations  
- 🧠 Model training using Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regressor  
- 📈 Evaluation using MAE, RMSE, and R² score  
- 🌐 Streamlit app for real-time predictions  

---

## 📚 Dataset

This project uses the [Student Performance Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It includes data on student demographics, academic performance, and behaviors, with the goal of predicting the final exam grade (`G3`).

## 🚀 Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ScoreGenie.git
   cd ScoreGenie
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
(Optional) Create a virtual environment:

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
🧪 Model Training & Evaluation
To train the model and see performance metrics:

bash
Copy
Edit
python main.py
This script performs:

Data loading and preprocessing

Train/test splitting

Model training

Evaluation using common regression metrics

📊 Run EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
To visualize and explore patterns in the dataset:

bash
Copy
Edit
python notebooks/eda.py
This will generate:

Summary statistics

Correlation heatmap

Grade distributions and feature relationships

🌐 Run the Streamlit App
To launch the interactive web app for making predictions:

bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
The app lets you:

Input student features (age, G1, G2, study time, etc.)

Get a predicted final grade (G3)

See results instantly in a user-friendly UI

Make sure to run from the root folder so relative paths resolve correctly.
